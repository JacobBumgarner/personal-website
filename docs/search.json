The educational articles in this collection were created for the educational benefit of myself and others.\n\nOverview\nEach article is created with the Feynman technique in mind, drawing inspiration from expert educators, including Grant Sanderson, Steve Mould, Gilbert Strang, and Destin Sandlin.\nBy writing these articles, I hope to distill the fundamental gist of each topic such that anyone can understand them. Of course, the topics I cover aren’t exhaustive and aren’t meant to replace textbooks or other online learning mediums. Instead, I hope they act as foundations for the introduction to topics or supplemental materials for the mastery of topics.\n\n\nTopics\nBelow is a list of the topics with covered material. Many of these topics have sub-sections, which can be opened by clicking the dropdown arrows.\n\nStatistics\nLinear Algebra\nMachine Learning\nDeep Learning\nBioinformatics\n\n\n\nResources\nBelow is a list of the resources I use to create these articles.\n\nManim\nCiteDrive\nQuarto\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "In many data-driven contexts, we become interested in understanding the relationship between two variables.\nFor example, let’s say we’ve run an experiment to test the effect of a novel drug on immune cell function. To test this drug, we treat 20 cultured dishes of immune cells (\\(n = 20\\)) with a single dose. As an outcome, we measure the concentration of two proteins from the treated cells: protein A and protein B.\nWhen we evaluate the results from the experiment, we can imagine different possible outcomes of the concentrations of proteins A and B in relation to one another:\n\nAs protein A concentration increases, protein B concentration also increases\nAs protein A concentration increases, protein B concentration does not change\nAs protein A concentration increases protein B concentration decreases\netc…\n\nAs you may have gathered, an important nuance of this example is that we are not particularly interested in understanding whether the concentration of protein A causes the concentration of protein B to change, or vice versa. Instead, we only want to evaluate how their concentrations change in relation to one another. This type of non-causal evaluation is symmetric in nature.\nTo evaluate symmetric relationships between two variables, one can examine their correlation. Formally, correlation is a measurement of the the strength, and sometimes direction, of a relationship between two variables1. When two variables are related to one another, such as in cases 1 and 3 from our example above, we say that they are correlated.\nImportantly, even if two variables are correlated, we can not use this correlation to make any assumptions about the causal nature of their relationship, begging the adage: correlation \\(\\neq\\) causation.\nRegardless of whether the relationship between two variables is causal or not, correlation statistics still provide an indication of underlying relationships between\nOften you will see that correlation tests evaluate linear relationships, but some correlation tests evaluate non-linear relationships as well."

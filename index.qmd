### About
My name is Jacob Bumgarner. I'm computational biologist with a passion for building
and writing.

Please feel free to connect with me through the links above.

### Career
I am currently a computational biologist specializing in reverse translational and
predictive sciences for drug development. I work to expand our understanding of
the mechanisms that drive neurodegenerative and autoimmune disease.

My experience encompasses computational biology, bioinformatics, software engineering,
and machine learning. I am driven by a passion for problem-solving and applying
my skills to improve human health.

### Education 
Prior to starting my career, I completed my Ph.D. in Neuroscience at West
Virginia University from 2019-2023, where I studied circadian rhythms, pain, and
cerebrovasculature in [Randy
Nelson's](https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/neuroscience/faculty-labs/randy-nelson-phd/)
lab.

Before that, I was a completed my B.M. (Bachelor of Music) from 2015-2019 at
West Virginia University, where I studied piano performance with [Ching-Wen
Hsiao](https://www.chingwenhsiao.com/) and learned the ropes of biomedical
research in [Paul Lockman's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-lockman-268b752a/)
lab.

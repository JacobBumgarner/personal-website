### About
My name is Jacob Bumgarner.

I'm a passionate learner, and I learn best when I'm creating and writing. This
website is a central hub for the lessons I've created from my studies.

### Career
I'm currently a bioinformatics scientist working in predictive sciences for 
drug development. 

I am experienced in bioinformatics, analytics, software engineering, and 
machine learning.

### Education 
Prior to starting my career, I was a doctoral student at West Virginia
University from 2019-2023, where I studied circadian rhythms, pain, and
cerebrovasculature in [Randy
Nelson's](https://medicine.hsc.wvu.edu/neuroscience/faculty-labs/randy-nelson-phd/)
lab.

Before that, I was a pianist from 2015-2019 at West Virginia University, where I
studied piano performance with [Ching-Wen Hsiao](https://www.chingwenhsiao.com/)
and learned the ropes of research in [Paul
Lockman's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-lockman-268b752a/) lab.
